# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview
This project aims to build an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to distinguish between cats and dogs in images. CNNs are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for image-related tasks, capable of learning and extracting intricate patterns and features from raw pixel data.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: The image data is preprocessed to normalize pixel values and resize images to a uniform size suitable for input into the CNN model.
- **Model Architecture**: A CNN model architecture is defined, comprising convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers for classification.
- **Training Procedure**: The CNN model is trained on a labeled dataset containing images of cats and dogs. During training, the model learns to extract relevant features and classify images accurately.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess its effectiveness in classifying images.
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Techniques such as data augmentation and dropout regularization are employed to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: The trained CNN model,Leveraging Pretrained Models: Utilize the Inception V3 model developed by Google, pretrained on ImageNet, to extract high-level image features and enhance the accuracy of the classification model.
- The accuracy of the model improved from 88% to 92%, resulting in a 4.5% relative improvement in accuracy.in distinguishing between cats and dogs in test images.
